# WorldWise
### (keep track your adventures)


Worldwise is an intuitive web application designed to help users document their travel experiences and future travel plans. Users can select cities or countries they have visited or plan to visit on an interactive map, add descriptions, and share their trip experiences. For places not yet visited, the app provides a Wikipedia link for additional information. Users can also specify the dates of their visits. When a city or country is selected from the list, the map pointer redirects to that location. Additionally, users can view a list of all the places they have visited and check the prices associated with their destinations on the price page. Worldwise offers a seamless way to track and explore travel adventures.
